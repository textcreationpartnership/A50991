            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SInce Poetry has had the good fortune hitherto, to be much eſteemed in the world, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the favourite of the Age: I hope it will not now fall ſhort of its own end, and my deſign, which is to divert and pleaſe; and how far I have conſulted this, may appear from the following work: where ſuch variety of Subjects cannot but be grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and a Miſcellany muſt needs yield more delight then one continued Poem; for the ſame reaſon I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, as at an Entertainment, moſt People are pleas'd with variety of Courſes, when a ſtanding Diſh would not at all gratify their Appetites. Now, as for the ſeveral Hands which have been ſo kind to obliege the world no doubt, as much as me, in contributing to this piece; I acknowledge it beyond my capacity to commend: And indeed could I do
<pb facs="tcp:40987:3"/>it, I preſume it would be altogether needleſs; ſince their own Poems will ſpeak their praiſe in a more ample manner. Yet I would not have you think I have commended theſe Poems ſo far upon my own Judgment; But that I have relyed wholy upon the Authority of able Criticks, to whom I left it wholy to approve, or diſapprove of what they pleas'd: know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be a prudent way for any one who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands not whether a Coin be counterfeit to refer himſelf to the Teſt of a Touchſtone: Whereupon I admitted no Coppy but what had ſtood this Tryal, and came of with reputation. Now after all this care and diligence, there remains nothing; but that I ſhould commit this piece to your Judgment, in whoſe Power it is to make it happy; wiſhing that it may carry worth enough in it to deſerve your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; and if ſo, aſſure your ſelf the undertaking will be very ſatisfactory to him, who has made it his buſineſs</p>

                  <l>Or could hmſelf ſo great a Maſter prove</l>
